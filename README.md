# mailchimp-search

## How this project came about

This project came about when I was contacted by a small booking company that used Mailchimp as a means to store their customer data but was unsatisfied with the integrated search functions.
The goal was to program a search function that is fast and intuitive. A map feature might be added in a later version.
Instructions on how to use the program are included in the program itself.

## How to use the program

To run this program yourself you need a version of Python 3 (might only work for versions >= 3.6). To install the requirements, run
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
in your copy of this directory. To test if it works, run
```
python3 app.py demo
```
in the same directory.

## Demo

A demo version of the program can be found [here](http://ec2-18-185-83-45.eu-central-1.compute.amazonaws.com/).
It has a basic map feature that is not included in this code since it is not fully fledged out yet.
